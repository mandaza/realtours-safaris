            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Real Tours Safaris was founded in 2008 by a team of passionate Zimbabwean guides who wanted to share the natural beauty and wildlife of their homeland with the world. What began as a small operation with just two vehicles and three guides has grown into one of Zimbabwe's most respected safari companies.</p>
            <p>Our founder, Emmanuel Moyo, believed that safari tours should not only showcase Africa's incredible wildlife but should also provide authentic cultural experiences and support local communities. This vision continues to guide everything we do.</p>
            <p>Today, we remain a proudly Zimbabwean-owned company, employing local guides and staff who have unparalleled knowledge of our country's wildlife, history, and culture.</p>

            <h2>Our Conservation Efforts</h2>
            <p>At Real Tours Safaris, conservation is at the heart of everything we do. We recognize that the incredible wildlife and habitats we showcase are precious resources that need protection.</p>
            <p>We contribute a portion of every booking to local conservation projects focused on protecting Zimbabwe's wildlife and natural habitats. Our current initiatives include anti-poaching efforts in Hwange National Park and community education programs about wildlife conservation.</p>
            <p>Our guides are also trained to educate visitors about conservation challenges and successes in Zimbabwe, helping to create global ambassadors for African wildlife conservation.</p>
